# Ender-3-S1-5axis
Final degree project: "Design and construction of a 5-axis FFF 3D printer"

The main objective of the project was to develop a low-cost 3D printer with multi-axis capabilities, starting from a commercial three-axis base (Creality Ender 3 S1) and adding two rotational axes (U and V), allowing for greater versatility in additive manufacturing, especially in the production of complex geometries without conventional supports and in the coating of cylindrical surfaces.

The work covered all design phases: from CAD modeling of the mechanical components, 3D printing of the custom parts, and complete system assembly, to the configuration of the Duet3D-based electronics and the creation of custom G-codes using tools such as FullControl GCode. A key part of the project was the design of specific print paths for five-axis extruder and platform orientation control.
